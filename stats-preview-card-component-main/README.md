## My process
I started with the mobile-first approach. The most easy thing to do in this challenge was the text part. But the image part gave me tough time. Glad it's done.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
-flexbox
- CSS Grid
-Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The most important thing that i learned by doing this challenge that only watching tutorials wouldn't help you to in understanding any language. Practice and making some projects is a must.
I learned some more css properties like mix-blend-mode, opacity and flexbox. The thing i liked the most is how easy it is to center content by using flexbox(Justify-content and align-items)

```html
.container{
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
I will explore more about flexbox and will use mobile-first approach in future projects.
